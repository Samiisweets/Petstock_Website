                Founded at the Jersey Shore in 2009, Tilted started as a hard rock cover band influences by the likes of KISS, AC/DC, Priest, Sabbath, Metallica, and many more.

In 2012, Tilted became more serious with their original songwriting talents and put together a new lineup introducing a new lead vocalist. With all original songs, Tilted hit these infamous spots at the Jersey Shore, finding themselves opening for national acts such as Skid Row, Dokken, Ace Frehley of KISS, Udo Dirkschneider from Accept, Hookers and Blow, Anvil, Corky Laing, and Tantric. They continue to make an impact at the Jersey Shore, and they show no signs of slowing down any time soon!
